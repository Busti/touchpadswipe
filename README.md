# TouchpadSwipe
Enables multitouch swipe (backwards/forwards) in chrome as in OSX. If your notebooks touchpad is configured to do horizontal scroll with two fingers f.e. you can use that gesture to go back and forward in chrome browser.

At the moment the extension is not submitted to the chrome extension store yet, because of its ALPHA state. Maybe this is done in future.

# How to use
Just install extension from chrome webstore: <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/touchpadswipe/hbolfopmehcpecgmcompfpgapnbgbhio>.
